Upon pressing again on the button to Add new device, we are given different option by means of tabs.





Give the DAU a recognizable name.   
You can give it the same name as the Equipment or a variation of it, for example.

Introduce the **IMEI** and **Serial Number** of the DAU.  
These can be found in the DAU Configuration page, the DAU box and the label on the device.

When enabling the geo-location, a time interval for location reporting must be set.  
The interval is set in minutes by means of a dropdown.  
An interval of zero \(0\) defines that the location is only sent one time just after power-up of the DAU.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Both IMEI and Serial Number must be correctly introduced or the system will not work.

Please note that only the IMEI has a validation of the input provided.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Quick Tip: If you kept DAU Configuration page open in your browser you can simply copy and paste the **IMEI** and **Serial Number** from one page to the other.
{% endhint %}
