Upon pressing again on the button to **Add new device**, we are given different option by means of tabs.

| Tab | Function |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Predefined devices** | Allows to create devices based on templates created by DEIF for the Equipment Type chosen earlier. |
| **My devices** | Allows to create devices based on templates created within the current account. |
| **New devices** | Allows to create devices based on empty or platform related templates. |

We will now click once on the **+** button on the AGC-4 DG box to add a new AGC-4 to the Equipment and then press **Save.**

The number of devices allowed on a single gateway depends on the Service Level attached.

We can now see that an AGC-4 controller has been created and linked to the device.

We can now change its settings by clicking on the pencil \(edit\) button.

Let's name it and proceed down.  
We now can see a bit more of the content of the new device.  
The next step is to give it the correct network setting
