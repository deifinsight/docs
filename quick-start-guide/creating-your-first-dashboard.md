## Adding content to the dashboard

Adding content to the dashboard is very easy.   
Simply press the **Add new widget** button and choose from a variety of Widgets and Widget Packs.

### Add a Widget

![There is a great variety of widgets to choose from](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2839%29.png)

Each widget has its own requirements in terms of configuration.  
Please note that Home and Group dashboards may introduce additional parameters to each widget.

The **Add now** option creates a widget with its default configuration.  
The **Edit first** option will open the widget configuration page.   
Please note that most widgets will require some configuration.

### Move things around

In dashboard editor mode, the widgets may be dragged and dropped freely around the dashboard.  
Most widgets also allow resizing.

{% endhint %}

### Add a Widget pack

Adding widgets to a dashboard is fun, but we made it easy to add multiple widgets in one simple action.  
Widget packs are sets of pre-configured widgets which can be added to a dashboard to provide almost instant value.

You can also create your own widget packs by selecting multiple widgets and selecting **Save to pack**.

![Choosing a pre-defined Widget pack for the dashboard](../.gitbook/assets/image%20%2836%29.png)

{% hint style="info" %}
Each dashboard type has its own listing of available Widget Packs.
{% endhint %}

After inserting a widget pack, the device must be selected on the widgets.  
If the tags defined in the pack are available for the particular device, then the tag is automatically inserted ****after the device is selected.

To finish and apply the changes, press the **Save** button.   
Alternatively, you can **Cancel** which will revert back to the last saved dashboard configuration.
