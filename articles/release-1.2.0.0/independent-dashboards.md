# Independent Dashboards

Previous to this release, Insight's dashboards shared a common template for each one of its dashboard types. See [Dashboards](../release-1.0.0.0/dashboards.md) on release 1.0.0.0.

Now, we have decided that dashboards should become independent of any templates. This maximises their customisation possibilities and allow diverse equipment of different characteristics to have their own visualisation dashboards without compromise.

We have also simplified the editing process and added possibility to copy a dashboard from one unit to the another.
